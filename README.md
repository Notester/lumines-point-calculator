# lumines-point-calculator
~~A program~~ Code to help simulate points earned in a Lumines run


## To-Do: 
- Allow for different numbers of squares cleared (either single number or picking from array of numbers) for each individual skin
- Show as much detail as possible for skins as they're ran through
- Make this into an actual executable program and not just code
